    Why Custom Gear?

  <div class="first-text-block">
    High quality, professional gear is an absolute MUST for any pro 
    wrestler. A wrestler's gear is an extension of themselves in the ring. Investing 
    in custom-designed gear is something that can elevate a wrestler's appearance, 
    brand, and confidence. Get gear made for YOU so you can look exactly the way you 
    want.

    What We Do
  </header>
  <div class="second-text-block">
    Our services are not limited to gear construction. Some wrestlers come to us with 
    rough ideas for gear, and need help creating a design. Some come to us 
    with gear that doesn't fit right and needs personal adjustments. Some send us 
    fully-developed design sketches and want us to meet their exact specifications. 
    Whatever gear-related needs you have, our team is ready to help you find exactly 
    what you need.

    We believe that communication is key, and want all our clients to feel satisfied 
    with their gear purchases. Throughout the gear-making process, we communicate with 
    our clients so they can see their gear come to life. We send regular photo updates 
    as the gear is constructued so the client can approve or ask for adjustments. The 
    last thing we want is to deliver a piece of gear that doesn't meet the client's 
    wishes, so we proactively communicate to make sure the gear meets expectations.

    Many sewing services and costume designers make highly-quality work, but don't 
    understand the needs of professional wrestling gear. Wrestling gear needs to be durable 
    to withstand in-ring action. Also the design must account for kickpads, kneepads, 
    and other accessories. We've had wrestlers 
    come to us with great, well-built gear from other gear makers, but tell us that 
    they're disappointed because their kneepads and kickpads will cover half of the 
    design. We do everything we can to make sure your gear will work for you 
    in the ring.
