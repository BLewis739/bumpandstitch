      Bump and Stitch was officially founded in April 2022, but was built from years of word-of-mouth reputation 
      for high-quality work. Over 3 years of making gear, our founder has constructed upwards of 100 items, ranging 
      from full designs to alterations of already-finished gear. We aspire to improve and grow with every project, 
      and are happy to take on new challenges.
