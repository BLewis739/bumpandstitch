      Bump and Stitch was officially founded in April 2022, but was built from years of individual requests and projects. 
      Over 3 years of making gear, our founder has constructed upwards of 100 items, ranging from full designs to alterations 
      of already-finished gear. The official Bump and Stitch business was launched due to the high number of requests 
      being received after having built up a reputation of high-quality work. We aspire to improve and grow with every project, 
      and are happy to take on new challenges.
